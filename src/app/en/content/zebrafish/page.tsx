                                According to the FDA report, global pharmaceutical companies, Novartis and Pfizer are reported using Zebrafish to reduce R&D costs by more than 10 million dollars per year.
                                In addition, FDA IND application were reported as only zebrafish research data in 2019, 2020 and 2021.
                                Zebrafish is emerging as a representative test model that can replace existing experimental animals.
